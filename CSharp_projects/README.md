# C# Projects

## Overview
This folder contains C# projects demonstrating various programming concepts, principles, and design patterns.  
Each project is implemented with a focus on **object-oriented programming**, **SOLID**, **GRASP**, and different types of **design patterns** (creational, structural, behavioral).  
All projects include unit tests to verify business logic.
